While one team member submits the form, all team members are required to join the Call for Code community and accept the Participation Agreement as part of the registration process.

Submission name: RGB Hunger Fighters

Confirm the name of your solution or team in approximately five words. Short description: Share excess food with community

Describe your team’s solution in approximately ten words. 
Share excess food with the community to avoid waste

Long description In approximately 500 words, describe your solution in more detail. Include the real-world problem you identified, describe the technological solution you have created, and explain how it’s an improvement over existing solutions. You can supply additional documentation in your source code repository link below. Solution roadmap:

The real world problem we are attempting to mitigate is food waste. It is common that as individuals we end up with quite literally more than we can chew. This can come in the form of planting a garden and reaping too much crop, or simply moving into a home with a fruit tree and not knowing what to do with the excess fruits. Not taking care to use this produce either leads to waste, or if left as ground-fall can lead to pests. 
Our idea specifically for RGB hunger fighters came to light with a focus on remote communities. In areas where food shops are dozens of miles away or reachable only by air or sea, it becomes increasingly important to share with the community wherever possible. Doing so, not only will help to reduce waste, reduce emissions by limiting those extra trips to the grocery shop, but also help bring the community together.
RGB Hunger Fighters is primarily an SMS based solution. It works with the backing of a machine learning engine. The user starts by taking a photo of the produce they have in excess, and sending it via Trulio to our RGB hunger fighter engine in Node Red. The machine learning database is able to classify the photo based on it’s produce type (ie. apple, banana, orange) and also determine the quantity available. This photo will be added to the website as an available item. Then it is up to another user to visit the site and click the photo of that produce to be sent an SMS message of the location of the produce and pick it up. The quantity auto classification will allow the produce to be claimable on the website a certain amount of times by multiple users. Alternatively, a user can opt to receive all future notifications for a particular produce type. This scenario is particularly useful if a nearby neighbour has a fruit tree that the other neighbours can benefit from.

Create a document or image that shows how mature your solution is today and how you would like to improve it in the future. This can include information on the business model, funding needs, and a sustainability plan. Here’s an example from the 2018 Call for Code winner Project Owl.
